# This workflow is inspired by the example shown at
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-java-with-gradle 
# Author Mathieu Fortin

# GitHub recommends pinning actions to a commit SHA.
# To get a newer version, you will need to update the SHA.
# You can also reference a tag or branch, but the action may change without warning.
